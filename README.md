The system here takes the data from user and adds it into the database (Using SQLite Database). It also checks for invalid mobile number if entered. If the number of digits are less than 10, the field turns red signifying the mobile number is wrong. Such fields are added in the system to assure valid data is entered. 
The two codes provided are EmployeeData.java and Employee.java

The Employee.java deals with the system development i.e. designing of the application, error detection and database.
